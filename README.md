# Rideshare Pilots

This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of having a assistance system for rideshare users to connect them with their drivers more efficiently. The project is based on AI planning technologies to demonstrate this in a simulated environment which can be viewed and also extended to model real world venues.

## Structure

- **`/game/`** - Core game environment and utilities for grid-based navigation and obstacle generation.
- **`/htn/`** - Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner implementation for solving the environment.
- **`/recordings/`** - Videos of game runs recorded for analysis.
- **`testing.ipynb`** - Jupyter notebook for testing and experimenting with the HTN planner in the game environment.
- **`play.py`** - Script to run the game and use keyboard controls for manual play.
