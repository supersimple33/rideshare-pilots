# Rideshare Pilots

This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of having a assistance system for rideshare users to connect them with their drivers more efficiently. The project is based on AI planning technologies to demonstrate this in a simulated environment which can be viewed and also extended to model real world venues.
