\section*{Assessment}
\begin{small}
    
Your report will be distinguished by the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Approach:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Clearly states the technical approach of the work in a self-contained way.
            \item The acting environment is clearly explained; stronger reports will include an example figure. If the environment started as a Gym environment but was modified, this is clear.
            \item Includes a planning and acting component.  For the acting, simulation is fine
            \item Stronger reports will leverage or manipulate the integration in an interesting way.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item Evaluation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Clear exposition of claims, questions, variables and protocol.
            \item Evidence to support the claims in the form of a table or plot and no table or plot has font smaller than \textbackslash scriptsize (about 6pt font).
            \item Plots have axes that are clearly labeled and their captions state their intended meaning.
            \item All plots and tables in Section~\ref{sec:figures-and-tables} are referenced in the main portion of the paper; supplemental plots that are not referenced should be placed in the appendix.  
            \item A discussion of findings and how evidence relates to the claims
            \item Stronger reports will have a baseline approach; while not required, there is already evidence of this in some reports.
            \item It is certainly not required for this report, but you are welcome to include tests of statistical significance if this is something you know how to do.
            \item The strongest reports will demonstrate what I call second-order thinking.  This is where you conjecture a possible reason for the results you saw.  It is even stronger if you run one or more experiments to verify this conjecture or provide analytical results showing why this is the case.
        \end{itemize}

    \item Scope and Writing
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Paper tells an interesting or noteworthy story rather than just a chronology of experiments. (Exhibits first-order thinking)
            \item Written content is 2-4 pages, excluding floats (figures and tables), and floats are correctly placed in Section~\ref{sec:figures-and-tables} to make this assessment easy!
            \item Writing is easy to understand
            \item Reader is not left "wondering".  Consider yourself a teacher of your project. What would your `student' need to know to understand the content?
            \item Grammar is mostly sound; no obvious typos, misspelled words, sentence fragments, etc.
            \item Citations are correct and consistent; URLs are fine for hyperlinks, but, generally, books and articles should use a bibtex entry. 
            
        \end{itemize}


%    \item New section
%        \begin{itemize}
%            \item Clear and concise claims
%        \end{itemize}

        
\end{itemize}

Student Assessment: Please complete the orange boxes, replacing text within \textless .. \textgreater.  For example, in the first entry you would replace "\textless replace:\{ 1, 2, 3 \} \textgreater" with "1" if you did a type 1 project. I suggest you change these one at a time and recomplile each time to make sure each change is correct.\\
