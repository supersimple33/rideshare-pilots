\section{Introduction}

Within the rideshare domain, a very common pain point is connecting with the rider with their matched driver. This is especially true in scenarios where there are likely to be a very large number of riders searching for rides, such as at a concert or sporting event. In these scenarios, it is common for riders to be matched with drivers that are not in their immediate vicinity, and thus the rider must navigate to the driver. This can be a difficult task, especially if the rider is unfamiliar with the area or if there are obstacles in the way.

While much attention in AI planning has been focused on achieving the best possible planning performance and plan quality little attention has been given to leveraging the ability to simulate people as actors in the environment. In this project, we simulate a rideshare user attempting to find their assigned car in a parking lot. Rather than identifying the best possible plan to find the car, we investigate how different environments effect the ability of an agent to find their car when acting in the environment with a simple planning and acting algorithm. This allows us to ultimately draw conclusions about how different environment characteristics effect the ability of an agent to successfully find their car with the hope being that these insights can be used to design better human rideshare experiences in the future. As rideshare services move towards greater autonomy and uniformity in car design, it is important to maximize the efficiency of the particularly human intensive tasks.

%==========================================================
%==========================================================
\section{Background}

The motivation for this project builds on concepts introduced in earlier work that highlighted a gap in research on the final 100 yards of on-foot navigation within the broader last-mile problem~\cite{sametPILOTPilotingLast2024}. We acknowledge that the difficulties faced by riders in locating their car once in a general vicinity (ie parking lot) are especially unique as compared to simply walking to said area from an original starting location. Prior work has explored the challenges of on-foot navigation in urban environments, but there is a lack of research specifically addressing the nuances of the search task that is rideshare pickup.

The issue of locating a rideshare vehicle goes far beyond simple time efficiency savings. There have been numerous cases of riders entering the wrong vehicle and being physically harmed such as the case of Samantha Josephson who was murdered after entering a car she thought was her Uber. This case and others motivated the creation of Sami's law~\cite{smithSamisLaw2023} which requires a study to be done on the number of assaulted riders each year and the safety measures taken. In general there is very little regulation around rideshare safety within the US as compared to countries like China~\cite{stemlerDataPrivacyRegulation2025} which regulate where and how rideshare pickups can occur. Therefore the lessons learned from this project should not only be used to improve efficiency but also safety of rideshare pickups ensuring that riders can quickly and accurately and safely find their rideshare vehicle.

This project uses \RunLazyLookahead, \cite{ghallabActingPlanningLearning2025}, Algorithm~2.4. Briefly, this acting algorithm checks whether the agent has reached the goal. If an existing plan exists and \alg{Simulate} is not failure, it performs the next action in the plan. Otherwise it creates a new plan. 

% (Notice the use of macros from the `macro.tex` file -- these are optional but can really improve the readability of your report.)
%On the other hand, some of you created your own procedures or used something from the literature.  In that case, it might be a good idea to include pseudocode if you modified something from the book or created your own algorithm.  I don't really want you to worry about using the algorithmic environment.  For purposes of this report, I will accept psuedocode `lite', which is basically the text like we have been using all semester, similar to the following:
%\begin{scriptsize}
%\begin{verbatim}
%    procedure CrossPrint(arg1, arg2, arg3)
%    Q := { arg1 x arg2 }
%    while |Q| < arg3:
%        print This statement is false.
%        unused_item = pop(Q)
%\end{verbatim}
%\end{scriptsize}
