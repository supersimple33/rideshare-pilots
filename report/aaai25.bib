  abstract = {In major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles County, ride-sharing systems can help reduce traffic congestion and increase the efficiency of the transportation system. This research project proposes three different solution approaches for solving the ride share routing problem with flexible pickup and drop-off points. The first is a dynamic programming-based route enumeration procedure that can be used to solve small-sized problems; the other two are branch and price-based heuristics for solving large problems. The researchers first provide a mixed integer nonlinear model for routing and pickup and drop-off points selection which they later decompose into a master and subproblem for solving. To validate the performance of their approaches and gather valuable insights about the ridesharing system, the researchers perform numerical experiments on a San Francisco Taxicab dataset. Results show that the approaches are efficient, solving instances with up to 300 nodes within 130 CPU seconds. For these datasets, incorporating flexible meeting points (i.e., pickup and drop-off points) can reduce the total travel time of the rideshare system by 18\%. Sensitivity analysis shows that it can also decrease the time passengers wait time for rides by 43\%. The methodologies in this study can help transportation planners design more efficient rideshare systems with less waiting, better passenger service, and less travel time.View the NCST Project Webpage},

  abstract = {AI's next big challenge is to master the cognitive abilities needed by intelligent agents that perform actions. Such agents may be physical devices such as robots, or they may act in simulated or virtual environments through graphic animation or electronic web transactions. This book is about integrating and automating these essential cognitive abilities: planning what actions to undertake and under what conditions, acting (choosing what steps to execute, deciding how and when to execute them, monitoring their execution, and reacting to events), and learning about ways to act and plan. This comprehensive, coherent synthesis covers a range of state-of-the-art approaches and models --deterministic, probabilistic (including MDP and reinforcement learning), hierarchical, nondeterministic, temporal, spatial, and LLMs --and applications in robotics. The insights it provides into important techniques and research challenges will make it invaluable to researchers and practitioners in AI, robotics, cognitive science, and autonomous and interactive systems.},

  abstract = {For many years, research in AI plan generation was governed by a number of strong, simplifying assumptions: The planning agent is omniscient, its actions are deterministic and instantaneous, its goals are fixed and categorical, and its environment is static. More recently, researchers have developed expanded planning algorithms that are not predicated on such assumptions, but changing the way in which plans are formed is only part of what is required when the classical assumptions are abandoned. The demands of dynamic, uncertain environments mean that in addition to being able to form plans -- even probabilistic, uncertain plans -- agents must be able to effectively manage their plans. In this article, which is based on a talk given at the 1998 AAAI Fall Symposium on Distributed, Continual Planning, we first identify reasoning tasks that are involved in plan management, including commitment management, environment monitoring, alternative assessment, plan elaboration, metalevel control, and coordination with other agents. We next survey approaches we have developed to many of these tasks and discuss a plan-management system we are building to ground our theoretical work, by providing us with a platform for integrating our techniques and exploring their value in a realistic problem. Throughout, our discussion is informal and relies on numerous examples; the reader can consult the various papers cited for technical details.},

  abstract = {In the field of mobility, the focus in the past few years has been on the proverbial last mile connectivity. However this paper, narrows the scope from "miles" to the "last 100 yards" presenting a unique sets of issues that are not seen at other levels. The last 100 yards encompass routing and connectivity issues within confined spaces such as houses, apartment building, office spaces and many others. Some of the challenges in this context include coordinating between traditional delivery services (e.g., Fedex, DHL or Amazon Prime) and specialized pilots authorized to operate within the human dominated spaces of the last 100 yards. Ensuring timely delivery of perishable items, addressing the risks of delivery theft and recipient accuracy, and managing the storage and redelivery of packages when recipient are not present further complicates the process. Despite the challenges, the last 100 yards also present opportunities for novel solutions based on automation, robotic routing, social modelling, and industrial planning. In these confined spaces fully automated robotic solutions become feasible as navigation speed and routes are limited and the area can be easily geofenced.},

  abstract = {Notwithstanding its many agreeable benefits, the sharing economy has presented numerous negative externalities and policy challenges. Foremost among these is the abuse of users' privacy, which is enabled by the capture of vast troves of data by sharing economy platforms. As humankind confronts the frontier of generative artificial intelligence, examining how privacy harms have been articulated and addressed in the context of ridesharing is a beneficial exercise and one that can be enhanced by looking beyond U.S. borders. This Article, therefore, uses a functionalist comparative law methodology to examine the regulation of ridesharing platforms concerning user data in the United States and China, and to reveal actionable insights for policymakers. Following a primer on comparative law methodology, the Article integrates Chinese- and English-language primary and secondary sources to compare the ridesharing data regulations of China and the United States along their institutional and substantive dimensions. We argue that China has effectively utilized the benefits of its federalist structure by promulgating a floor of data privacy regulations at the national level that enables local regulators to address local realities while also preserving the incentives to innovate that are so important for technology firms. We suggest that a national regulatory floor would also promote consistency and innovation in the United States and would similarly enable regulators to speedily and efficiently respond to market failures in fast-paced technology sectors. We also argue that the utilization of technology to enhance the regulatory oversight of technology firms would behoove the United States, though perhaps with the addition of certain guardrails that do not exist in the Chinese legal environment.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a continuously growing field that has the potential to revolutionize many areas of artificial intelligence. However, despite its promise, RL research is often hindered by the lack of standardization in environment and algorithm implementations. This makes it difficult for researchers to compare and build upon each other's work, slowing down progress in the field. Gymnasium is an open-source library that provides a standard API for RL environments, aiming to tackle this issue. Gymnasium's main feature is a set of abstractions that allow for wide interoperability between environments and training algorithms, making it easier for researchers to develop and test RL algorithms. In addition, Gymnasium provides a collection of easy-to-use environments, tools for easily customizing environments, and tools to ensure the reproducibility and robustness of RL research. Through this unified framework, Gymnasium significantly streamlines the process of developing and testing RL algorithms, enabling researchers to focus more on innovation and less on implementation details. By providing a standardized platform for RL research, Gymnasium helps to drive forward the field of reinforcement learning and unlock its full potential.
