  abstract = {AI's next big challenge is to master the cognitive abilities needed by intelligent agents that perform actions. Such agents may be physical devices such as robots, or they may act in simulated or virtual environments through graphic animation or electronic web transactions. This book is about integrating and automating these essential cognitive abilities: planning what actions to undertake and under what conditions, acting (choosing what steps to execute, deciding how and when to execute them, monitoring their execution, and reacting to events), and learning about ways to act and plan. This comprehensive, coherent synthesis covers a range of state-of-the-art approaches and models –deterministic, probabilistic (including MDP and reinforcement learning), hierarchical, nondeterministic, temporal, spatial, and LLMs –and applications in robotics. The insights it provides into important techniques and research challenges will make it invaluable to researchers and practitioners in AI, robotics, cognitive science, and autonomous and interactive systems.},

  abstract = {In the field of mobility, the focus in the past few years has been on the proverbial last mile connectivity. However this paper, narrows the scope from "miles" to the "last 100 yards" presenting a unique sets of issues that are not seen at other levels. The last 100 yards encompass routing and connectivity issues within confined spaces such as houses, apartment building, office spaces and many others. Some of the challenges in this context include coordinating between traditional delivery services (e.g., Fedex, DHL or Amazon Prime) and specialized pilots authorized to operate within the human dominated spaces of the last 100 yards. Ensuring timely delivery of perishable items, addressing the risks of delivery theft and recipient accuracy, and managing the storage and redelivery of packages when recipient are not present further complicates the process. Despite the challenges, the last 100 yards also present opportunities for novel solutions based on automation, robotic routing, social modelling, and industrial planning. In these confined spaces fully automated robotic solutions become feasible as navigation speed and routes are limited and the area can be easily geofenced.},
